The input file name is expected to be passed as the first argument when calling Julia (i.e. it should be available via ARGS. This function is expected to be called from queuing system jobscripts, for example:\n\njulia --project -e 'using AiidaDFTK; AiidaDFTK.run()' /path/to/input/file.json\n\nIt automatically dumps a logfile file.log (i.e. basename of the input file with the log extension), which contains the log messages (i.e. @info, @warn, ...).
